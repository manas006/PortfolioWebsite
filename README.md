# Project 1: Hydrologic- Data Exploration

-   The goal of data exploration is to learn about characteristics and potential problems of a data set without the need to formulate assumptions about the data beforehand.

-   **Two key advantages of data exploration are:**

    1.  to enable unexpected discoveries in the data

    2.  to enrich a deep understanding of the data as an important fundament for successful and efficient projects.

-   **The results of this step are answers to important questions such as:**

    -   *Is the available data sufficient and suitable to achieve the project goals?*

    -   Do we know enough about the causes of anomalies, trends, gaps, etc.?


-   **Challenges** faced during hydrological observations:

    1.  The "variability of variability". How do we progress from assumptions about 'normal' climate variability and reflect the slower underlying processes of climate change?

    2.  Translating model outputs into appropiately used decision support tools

    3.  Bringing people into the models -- and the modelling process
